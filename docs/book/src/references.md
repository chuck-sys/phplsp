## LSPs written in Rust

**Rust Analyzer.** [Link][ra.gh]. Rust Analyzer itself. Enough said.

**phpls-rs.** [Link][phpls-rs.gh]. Archive of someone else's attempt at this exact problem without
treesitter.

**pylyzer.** [Link][pylyzer.gh]. Python LSP in Rust. Somewhat mature (in comparison with the PHP attempt),
but still missing a large amount of features.
